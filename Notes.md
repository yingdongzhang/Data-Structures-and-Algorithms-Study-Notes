# Problem Solving

Steps:
1. Understand the problem - rephrase the problem in your own words and confirm your understanding
1. Write concrete examples, inputs & outputs - simple examples -> Complex examples -> empty inputs -> invalid inputs
1. Break it down - write notes/sudo code to break the problem down
1. Solve or simplify
    1. Find the core difficulty in what you are trying to do
    1. Temporarily ignore that difficulty
    1. Wite a simplified solution
    1. Then incorporate that difficulty back in
1. Look back and refactor
    1. Different approach
    1. Readability
    1. Improve performance
    1. Have other people solved it in better ways?
